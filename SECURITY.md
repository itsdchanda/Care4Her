# Security Policy – Care4Her

At Care4Her, we take the security of our project seriously. We are committed to ensuring the safety and privacy of our users and their data. This policy outlines our security approach and supported versions.

## Supported Security

- **Dependencies & Libraries**: We keep all dependencies updated to the latest stable versions with security fixes.

## Security Best Practices

We encourage contributors to follow these practices:

1. **Secure Authentication** – Use encrypted credentials, password hashing, and HTTPS.
2. **Input Validation** – Sanitize inputs to prevent XSS, SQL injection, etc.
3. **Data Protection** – Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
4. **Authorization & Access Control** – Implement role-based access controls.
5. **Error Handling** – Avoid exposing system details; log errors securely.
6. **Secure Communication** – Ensure data is transmitted over HTTPS.
7. **Regular Updates** – Stay current with dependency patches and security fixes.
